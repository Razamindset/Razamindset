<h2 align="left">👨‍💻 Who am I</h2>

<p align="left">
I've been coding for 4 years now. I’ve worked with <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>JavaScript</strong>, and <strong>C++</strong>. I've been building little by little alongside my studies.<br><br>

I'm passionate about <strong>physics</strong>, <strong>math</strong>, and <strong>science</strong>. I also play chess — check out my <a href="https://www.chess.com/member/razamindset" target="_blank">chess.com profile</a> ♟️.<br><br>

In Python, I've worked with <strong>Flask</strong> and <strong>KivyMD</strong>. My go-to web framework is <strong>Next.js</strong> 🚀.<br><br>

I'm currently building a <strong>chess engine in C++</strong> and diving into <strong>machine learning</strong> and <strong>deep learning</strong>. I even built my own 3-layer neural network from scratch — check out the pinned repo!<br><br>

You can also find older web projects on my <a href="https://github.com/Ali-Raza764" target="_blank">old GitHub account</a> 🗃️.<br><br>

If you ever want to collaborate or just chat, hit me up on Discord: <code>@razamindset</code> 💬<br><br>

❤️ Love from Pakistan.
