<h2 align="left">Who am I</h2>

<p align="left">
I've been coding for 4 years now. I’ve worked with <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>JavaScript</strong>, and <strong>C++</strong>. I've been building little by little alongside my studies.<br><br>

I'm passionate about <strong>physics</strong>, <strong>math</strong>, and <strong>science</strong>. I also play chess — check out my <a href="https://www.chess.com/member/razamindset" target="_blank">chess.com profile</a> ♟️.<br><br>

In Python, I've worked with <strong>Flask</strong> and <strong>KivyMD</strong>. My go-to web framework is <strong>Next.js</strong> 🚀.<br><br>

I'm currently building a <strong>chess engine in C++</strong> and writing <strong>machine learning models</strong> and <strong>deep NNs</strong> from.scratch. — check out the pinned repo!<br><br>

I am also deeply interested in quantum physics and quantum computing.

You can also find older web projects on my <a href="https://github.com/Ali-Raza764" target="_blank">old GitHub account</a> 🗃️.<br><br>
